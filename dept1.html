In India, after completing MBBS degree, postgraduate study in ophthalmology is required. The degrees are Doctor of Medicine,
 Master of Surgery, Diploma in Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery, and Diplomate of National Board. The concurrent training and work 
experience are in the form of a junior residency at a medical college, eye hospital, or institution under the supervision of experienced 
faculty. Further work experience in form of fellowship, registrar, or senior resident refines the skills of these eye surgeons.
 All India Ophthalmologist Society and various state-level ophthalmologist societies hold regular conferences and actively promote 
continuing medical education.In the 17th and 18th centuries, hand lenses were used by Malpighi, and microscopes by Leeuwenhoek, 
preparations for fixing the eye for study by Ruysch, 
and later the freezing of the eye by Petit. 
This allowed for detailed study of the eye and an advanced model. Some mistakes persisted, such as: why the pupil changed size 
(seen to be vessels of the iris filling with blood), the existence of the posterior chamber, and the nature of the retina. 
Unaware of their functions, Leeuwenhoek noted the existence of photoreceptors, however, they were not properly discovered until 
Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus in 1834.
Around 1750, Jacques Daviel advocated a new treatment for cataract by extraction instead of the
traditional method of couching. Georg Joseph Beer (1763â€“1821) was an Austrian ophthalmologist and leader of the First Viennese 
School of Medicine. He introduced a flap operation for treatment of cataract (Beer's operation), as well as popularizing the instrument 
used to perform the surgery (Beer's knife).
